We are individuals greatly interested in the concepts and philosophies encapsulated within Buddhist Sutras. In Buddhism, the concept of karma, which refers to the moral valence of actions and their consequences, suggests that actions have repercussions not only immediately but also in future lifetimes. Importantly, the outcomes of good and bad deeds do not cancel each other out, meaning that each has its own consequences. Even the Buddha was not exempt from the effects of his own karma before achieving enlightenment. This concept of karma is considered by many as a compelling expression of cosmic fairness.

The objective of this project is to utilize large language model (LLM) technology to create a neutral master on Buddhist Sutras that can run on consumer hardware. Technology will evolve rapidly, and future advancements will undoubtedly facilitate better explanations, more detailed elaboration, improved accuracy, and greater consistency. Nevertheless, regardless of whether the master is human or machine and no matter how advanced the technology becomes, the necessity for critical thinking to interpret the teachings remains non-negotiable.

Buddhism has a strong tradition of rational thinking and inquiry. From its early days, Buddhism has emphasized critical thinking and direct experience as means to gain insight and understanding. Building on this foundation, a system of Buddhist logic was developed, featuring rigorous analytical techniques for debating and dismantling incorrect views. This system underscores the importance of understanding reality as it truly is, free from delusion. An integral part of this understanding is reflected in the Three Dharma Seals, which are principles that serve as the defining characteristics of genuine Buddhist teachings. If a teaching possesses these three seals, it can be considered authentically Buddhist. These seals are fundamental concepts that help followers discern the nature of existence and the essence of the Buddha's teachings. They include Impermanence (Anicca), which highlights the constant change of all phenomena; Suffering (Dukkha), indicating that attachment to transient things leads to suffering; and Non-self (Anatta), asserting the absence of an unchanging self in conditioned phenomena.

The ultimate state of self-realization is beyond words and concepts, beyond the duality of language. Sutras serve as guides that can lead to self-realization, offering various paths. It's up to each individual to determine which sutra resonates best with them, as there is no single sutra that can suit everyone. This highlights the personalized journey toward enlightenment, underscoring the significance of individual choice and reflection in the process. Furthermore, the Buddha emphasized that all teachings should be viewed as tools, but not as reality; they are useful, yet ultimately not to be clung to.

Finally, we would like to clarify our position and intentions. Our activities are confined to the capabilities of our own resources, without seeking external funding, donations, or collaborations.
